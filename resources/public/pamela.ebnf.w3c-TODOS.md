# Notes about the generation of pamela.ebnf.w3c

For the most part, the `pamela.ebnf.w3c` file is automatically generated by `insta2w3c` from `pamela.ebnf` (as described in [grammar.md](../../doc/grammar.md))

However, there are a few minor bugs in this process, requiring hand edits of `pamela.ebnf.w3c` for the following:

* symbol
* keyword
* float
* cost<= 
* reward>=

It's been a very low priority task to correct these in the source `pamela.ebnf` and/or `insta2w3c`
